## Earthquake Visualisation \
Dataset used is from USGS (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson)\

Using Leaflet, I create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.\
Popups provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
